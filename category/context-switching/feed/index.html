					<description><![CDATA[Most of the convenience our devices give us is garbage. I’ll never be bored enough to get the benefits of boredom if I’m never more than a moment away from more content.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of my favorite writers,&nbsp;<a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a>, wrote in his book&nbsp;<em>Steal Like an Artist</em>&nbsp;of how we are all mashups. From our genetics to our creative influences, we are the sum of many parts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said ‘We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.’</p></blockquote>



<p>We are also shaped by our habits. I worry that in my life I too often choose to dive into a screen rather than spending time thinking or reading. Activities that used to be confined to our computers, such as social media, now live in our pockets and are available all the time.</p>



<p>Making hard decisions about what we allow on our devices can make a huge difference in our quality of life.</p>



<p>I don’t need a world of on-demand video on my phone. If it’s there I will spend time watching it.</p>



<p>I don’t need Twitter (or Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or Pinterest) on my phone. I’ll never be bored enough to get the benefits of boredom if I’m never more than a moment away from more content.</p>



<p>I don’t need notifications for most apps. Notifications pull my attention away from doing work (or anything else!) deeply and with quality.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/">Context switching</a>&nbsp;is brutal and I want to avoid it whenever possible.</p>



<p>Most of the convenience our devices give us is garbage. It’s input we should avoid. I need to curate the influences in my life because those influences shape who I am.</p>
