					<description><![CDATA[Letters from one of my mentors inspired me to start writing letters. This is definitely not something most people of my generation do, but it's very fulfilling.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of my mentors growing up was a local man named Tony. Tony was in real estate and seemed to know everyone. He volunteered at church and spent a lot of time with the young men in my youth group. Even though he was older, he went with us on campouts and was always up for an adventure. A great man!</p>



<p>One of the things I took for granted during the years Tony was part of my life were the notes and cards he sent.</p>



<p>If your name ever appeared in the local paper for honor roll or a sporting accomplishment, a few days later you’d get a letter of congratulations. My first public talk at church was terrible, but Tony sent me a thank you note a few days later. Every note was hand written and always included a Tony dad joke.</p>



<p>Seven years ago I moved back to my home town and Tony and his wife still lived in the area. The first time my son gave a talk in church, a note arrived in the mail a few days later from Tony. Through most of this time Tony was suffering from pancreatic cancer and was in a lot of pain, he never stopped showing gratitude and spreading joy with his terrible jokes. At his funeral last year many people mentioned receiving letters from him over the years. I decided I would try and keep a bit of Tony’s spirit alive in me by becoming a letter writer.</p>



<p>I’ve had mixed success. One of the hard things with writing letters today is that hardly anyone responds in kind. It took me until the middle of last year to decide I would write my letters by hand and that seemed to make a difference to how I felt about the letters, even if it didn’t improve my response rate. There’s something about writing a letter by hand that makes the process more meaningful. I think I usually get more out of the letters than the people I write to.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in trying your hand at letter writing, here are a couple of resources that I found useful:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/7-letters-to-write-before-you-turn-70/">7 Letters to Write Before You Turn 70</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-art-of-letter-writing/">The Art of Letter Writing</a></li></ul>



<p>A couple of things have made letter writing a lot more enjoyable for me. I started using <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2015/10/1/the-beginners-guide-to-fountain-pens-by-a-true-beginner" class="ek-link">a fountain pen</a>. I’m definitely a novice in that world, but I do really enjoy the feel of the pen gliding over nice paper. It makes the experience something to look forward to. Nice paper makes a surprising difference. I bought a ream of heavy writing paper, cut it from letter size to half sheets, and made my own stationary.</p>
