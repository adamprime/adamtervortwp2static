					<description><![CDATA[At a recent MLB baseball game I learned how to score the game using paper and pencil. It made the game come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. Highly recommended!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently my family went together to a KC Royals baseball game, only my second live game of the season. Usually at the park I’m on my phone between innings (along with nearly everyone else!) but I decided it would be a pen and paper only game. I wasn’t interested in journaling during the game and the Royals have once again not give us much to be grateful for this season, so instead I decided I would learn how to score the game.</p>



<p>This is new to me. When my boys played little league I helped coach and I love to watch baseball. I just never had anyone teach me how to score a game. (And I was always a bit embarrassed about this when I was asked to help out at their games. Run the scoreboard? Sure. Score the game? Sorry, I don’t know how to do that.)</p>



<p>We arrived just before first pitch and I got the lineup info entered. Then I realized I had no idea what to do next. I asked the folks around me if they knew how to keep score, but no one did.</p>



<p>Luckily the internet saved me. The Art of Manliness, one of my favorite blogs, had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-score-a-baseball-game-with-pencil-and-paper/">great article on scoring a game with pencil and paper</a>. By the bottom of the 2nd inning I was in the groove!</p>



<p>It turns out watching baseball while keeping score is much more exciting than just watching. There’s so much more context! The ballpark also has a lot of little helps, hidden in plain sight, to help people keeping score. Not sure if that double play in the 4th inning was a 6-4-3 or a 4-6-3? Wait for the batter to come back up and the right score will be on the big screen.</p>



<p>Subtracting my phone from the game made it so much better. Adding in the great tradition of scoring by hand made the game come alive. Analog for the win again!</p>
