<p>The last few Wednesdays have been big days for me. I started hosted  YouTube live broadcasts for SpiderOak. While Iâ€™ve done similar things before, making training videos, running a webinar, or recording audiobooks, I had never hosted a livestream. It is an exciting project to get started on, but terrifying at the same time. If youâ€™re interested in taking a look at how the first one turned out, hereâ€™s the link:Â <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpHoJ2V68xI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpHoJ2V68xI</a></p>



<p>So how did it go? Iâ€™m pretty pleased. The number of attendees was in line with what I was hoping for, the presentation worked well, and I was able to start on time, end on time, and not have any technical glitches in the middle. Hooray!</p>



<p>The other side of the story is that with only 15 minutes left until start time, I wasnâ€™t sure it would happen.</p>



<p>I spent a lot of time preparing the technology stack on my computer and the hardware in my office. I used the excellentÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mmhmm.app/" target="_blank">mmhmm</a>Â as the camera and presentation software. I have a green screen which attaches to the back of my chair so I can have a nice virtual background. I got out my Blue Yeti microphone and had it hooked up and ready to go so the audio would be decent. My slides and software to demonstrate was all loaded into mmhmm and I had practiced the presentation several times. With 30 minutes to go I was feeling great.</p>



<p>Then I went to YouTube and tried to start the stream in preparation for going live. No dice! When I scheduled the livestream, I chose the option to create it with an encoder instead of my webcam. Turns out once youâ€™ve scheduled it, thereâ€™s no way to change that setting. YouTubeâ€™s documentation was pretty good, however, so I figured all I needed to do was install a software encoder, enter the correct settings, and I would be good to go. 20 minutes to go!</p>



<p>I installed three different software encoders, but couldnâ€™t get them running. I had missing drivers for some, some preferred a different version of Mac than what I run, and others were just confusing. With 10 minutes until live, I found Stage Ten, got mmhmm set up as my streaming source, connected it to the YouTube account, and confirmed the stream was ready.Â <em>Looking up at the clock, I had two minutes to spare.</em>Â <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f605.png" alt="ðŸ˜…" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>At 12:30 pm the livestream started on time. Iâ€™d been so busy trying to get everything set up that I didnâ€™t have time to be nervous! That was the hidden gift in the whole adventure.</p>



<p>Had I known this was how the prep would go I donâ€™t think I would have volunteered for the project. What a great learning experience it turned out to be! Hereâ€™s my big takeaway: if you take a leap of faith and work hard, great things can happen. Youâ€™re not guaranteed a happy ending, but the journey itself will make the experience worth it.</p>
