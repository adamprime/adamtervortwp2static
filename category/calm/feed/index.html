					<description><![CDATA[The most inspiring thing I did today was taking a morning walk. It's amazing. Solitude and nature fuel creativity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Walking is such a natural act, but many people don’t do much of it. This isn’t (necessarily) because we’re lazy. Some places aren’t well situated for frequent walking. If that’s true for you it’s still worth creating the time to walk. Walking without music, podcasts, or headphones provides a perfect environment for inspiration.</p>



<p>This morning it was 37ºF (3ºC) when I started walking. It took a few minutes for my joints to warm up, then everything else did too. Listening to the birds, watching the squirrels, and saying hello to fellow walkers took up a bit of the walk, but most of the time was calm and quiet.</p>



<p>I planned for a department meetup. Marketing ideas bubbled and stewed. Concepts from a book resurfaced with ways to apply them.</p>



<p>As the sun came out it warmed everything up nicely. I watched a dog play in a creek, saw a squirrel make an impossible jump, and even ran across some deer.</p>



<p>By the time I received my first notification on my phone the day was planned and it was time to turn around and head for work.</p>



<p>So much of our life is spent rushing. Make time for a walk. When you have uninterrupted time to think amazing things happen.</p>
