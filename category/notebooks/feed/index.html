					<description><![CDATA[I've been struggling with the Bullet Journal method so I created my own variation. It combines BuJo with the 5 Minute Journal to create a spread of pages for each day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve been struggling a bit with my journal. For the past couple of months I’ve been using the Bullet Journal method. I like it, but it is restrictive. Sometimes I find myself just not writing because I don’t want to decide how to categorize or add something to my index. I appreciate some aspects of the system, but not all are for me. I am coming to the end of a notebook and I wanted to make an adjustment so I can make better use of the new one.</p>



<p>I also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehealthloft.ca/the-perfect-morning-routine-for-high-achievers/">ran across an article</a>&nbsp;recently that mentioned the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/">5 Minute Journal</a>&nbsp;. I always like the concept behind that. The issue for me was that I didn’t want to buy a journal that was only 5 Minute Journal entries. (It’s a combination gratitude journal and basic daily planner. Useful, but hardly able to function as a catch-all.)</p>



<p>So I made my own mashup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="776" src="https://adamtervort.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-mashup-1024x776.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2784" srcset="https://adamtervort.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-mashup-1024x776.jpg 1024w, https://adamtervort.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-mashup-300x227.jpg 300w, https://adamtervort.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-mashup-768x582.jpg 768w, https://adamtervort.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-mashup.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On the left is the outline of a 5 Minute Journal entry. On the right, a slightly more structured BuJo page. This means I’ll be using one spread per day, which will use more notebooks, but I’m actually excited to write in it again. The past few days have been excellent, both in terms of capturing the things I need to do, and in terms of allowing me to evaluate my day and make improvements.</p>



<p>The other change I’ve made recently is carrying around a small field notes-sized notebook with me. I think of it as my “everyday carry” notebook. Anything fun or interesting that I hear or see goes into it. There isn’t intended to be lots of meaning here, just a place to jot and doodle. When I’m back at my desk I can transfer over anything significant into my main journal.</p>



<p>I also added a larger notebook that my writing goes into. Everything from blog posts to presentations to talks start off in the big notebook and are written by hand. The second draft happens when I type them into the computer.</p>

<p>H/T to <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/02/19/notebook-turducken/">Austin Kleon</a> and <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/06/david-sedaris-breaks-down-his-writing-process.html">David Sedaris</a> for the idea of using multiple notebooks together in a loose system.</p>
