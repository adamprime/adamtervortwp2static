<p>I haven’t written much this month. With everything going on in the world, taking the time to write a post each day seemed almost self absorbed. I wanted to keep my family close and focus on helping them and others in my community. This week I’ve started to feel that our new, stay-at-home normal has reached the point of equilibrium and I have some mental space to start writing again.</p>



<p>What I have been doing a lot this month is reading. Sites like <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain Pickings</a>, <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raptitude</a>, <a href="https://www.bakadesuyo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barking up the Wrong Tree</a>, and <a href="https://fs.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farnam Street</a> have helped a lot. I hope something of what I write helps others in the way these writers (and many others) have helped me.</p>

<p><a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/03/pandemic-a-poem-by-lynn-ungar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pressfield</a> shared this excellent poem by <a href="http://www.lynnungar.com/poems/pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynn Ungar</a>. It’s so good I want to pass it along to you. I hope during this time of disruption we can find positive change as we reach out to each other with our hearts.</p>



<h2 id="pandemic">Pandemic</h2>



<p>What if you thought of it<br>as the Jews consider the Sabbath—<br>the most sacred of times?<br>Cease from travel.<br>Cease from buying and selling.<br>Give up, just for now,<br>on trying to make the world<br>different than it is.<br>Sing. Pray. Touch only those<br>to whom you commit your life.<br>Center down.</p>



<p>And when your body has become still,<br>reach out with your heart.<br>Know that we are connected<br>in ways that are terrifying and beautiful.<br>(You could hardly deny it now.)<br>Know that our lives<br>are in one another’s hands.<br>(Surely, that has come clear.)<br>Do not reach out your hands.<br>Reach out your heart.<br>Reach out your words.<br>Reach out all the tendrils<br>of compassion that move, invisibly,<br>where we cannot touch.</p>



<p>Promise this world your love–<br>for better or for worse,<br>in sickness and in health,<br>so long as we all shall live.</p>



<p>–Lynn Ungar 3/11/20</p>
