					<description><![CDATA[You are not your thoughts, but it's hard to realize that when your thoughts constantly crash down all around you. Mindfulness teaches us how to observe our thoughts.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of my favorite vacations was a camping trip in Taiwan where I got to go River Trekking. This is hiking upstream in a river. It’s very intense and calls for you to climb over boulders, swim through deep spots in the river, push against the current, and generally have a great time playing in the water. At the end of our trek, a small 10 foot waterfall fell into a deep pool. My friends and I swam over to the waterfall and spent a few minutes playing in and around it. I’ll never forget the feeling of the water pounding down on my head, the power of the waterfall, and how it blocked out all other sensations.</p>



<p><strong>Our thoughts are like a waterfall.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes they trickle and sometimes they pound down, but our thoughts never really stop. The commentary running in our heads is relentless. When we focus on it, our thoughts have the power to completely absorb our reality.</p>



<h2 id="you-are-not-your-thoughts"><strong><em>You are not your thoughts.</em></strong></h2>



<p>That voice in your head, the constantly running commentary with the force of a waterfall, is not who you are. It seems amazing that I made it into my late 30s before I learned this simple fact. Just because my thoughts are in my head doesn’t mean that my thoughts are who I am.</p>



<p><strong>One of the keys to mindfulness is learning to observe and be aware of your thoughts.</strong>&nbsp;Just because there is a waterfall of thoughts running through your head, it doesn’t mean you must stand beneath it and be pummeled. It’s possible to observe and be aware of your thoughts without getting caught up in them. It’s like watching a waterfall from the shore rather than standing beneath it.</p>



<p>This is incredibly liberating, though of course it’s easier said than done. Being aware of your thoughts means you observe the things running through your mind without interacting with them. Since you are not your thoughts, there is no reason to judge yourself based solely on your thoughts. Watch them as they float by, be aware of them. As you do this you’ll be struck by how varied, strange, and absurd your mind can be.</p>



<p>This shouldn’t really be a surprise when you think about the wild and outlandish world of your dreams. We’ve all had dreams that make us shake our head in amazement when thinking back on them, right? It shouldn’t be a shock then that our conscious thoughts can wander into strange places too.</p>



<p>Training our mind to be aware of and observe our thoughts is just as important as training our body through exercise. Take time each day to practice mindfulness, whether through meditation, solitude, or any other way that works for you. Enjoy the waterfall of your thoughts from the shore instead of from under the waterfall.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spend more time alone with your mind. An idle mind is the fertile ground ideas grow in.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the issues I see in the youth I work with is a need for constant entertainment. It makes sense; all the entertainment in the world exists on that small screen we carry around in our pocket. We have lost the ability to tolerate boredom.</p>



<p>This is a problem because an idle mind is the fertile ground that ideas grow in. In my life I’ve seen the truth of the old saying that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/11/there-is-a-creative-purpose-to-daydreaming-even-boredom/417183/">creative ideas come while you’re in bed, in the bath, or on the bus</a>. (For me it’s more like while mowing the lawn, driving, or swimming, but the premise is the same.) If we don’t give your mind input it’s amazing what it will create on its own.</p>



<p>But this inability to deal with boredom is deeper than just a habit of looking at our phones. If we don’t spend time alone with our mind we start to feel uncomfortable when we’re “alone with ourselves.” Introspection and pondering are skills that need to be developed.</p>



<p>Meditation is a great way to start getting comfortable with our own mind. If you’ve never tried meditation a good place to start is the free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oakmeditation.com/">Oak Meditation app</a>. Most meditation apps seem to feel you need a monthly subscription to be mindful. Oak is not one of those.</p>



<p>However you do it, spend more time alone with your mind. Go for a walk without your phone or headphones, sit calmly and think about your day, or try doing the dishing while going over problem in your mind. It will lower the stress in your life. You’ll also discover that you’re a pretty great person to spend time alone with.</p>
