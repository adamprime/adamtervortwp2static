					<description><![CDATA[Today I listened to music with some musicians and noticed an interesting thing. When musicians listen, they really listen with full attention.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listening to music with musicians is interesting. Most musicians I know think of listening to music as an activity you do exclusively; not while reading a book, not while looking at your phone, or while working on email. The music deserves full attention while it’s playing. You learn and gain from the music by listening attentively and deeply.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that musicians don’t like background music. They do, but they also have the annoying habit of actually listening to the background music much more than normal people do. (If you’re friends with musicians you’ve probably had the experience where they groan for no reason or interrupt you to say “I love this song” when you were unaware there was music playing.)</p>



<p>Imagine if everyone listened deeply all the time. How would our conversations be different? How much time could we save in meetings? How many misunderstandings could be avoided? How much more affection would we perceive? The next time you’re in a situation where listening is important, whether to music, to a friend, or even to the news, listen deeply.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It can be funny when acronyms are misunderstood. Just make sure it's not an exclusionary stumbling block to your team or your customers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>…and I wouldn’t be brave enough to tell you if I didn’t.</p>



<p>My first three months working at a tech company I was constantly looking up acronyms just so I could understand what people were discussing on the company chat. It felt silly to have to do that, but at least I was able to catch up quickly.</p>



<p>Now that I have teenagers they will occasionally deign to translate their acronyms for me, the old guy. In a family group chat they’ll say, “BRB. In case Dad is wondering that means Be Right Back.” Funny kids I have, right?</p>



<p>All of this is mostly harmless and kind of fun. Just make sure that acronyms don’t exclude people from the work you and your team do. Internally it can be inconvenient. For your customers it can be a deal breaker.</p>



<p><em>HT to <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2019/12/26">Stephan Pastis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYS1gm8tZSM">Studio C</a> for the inspiration.</em></p>
