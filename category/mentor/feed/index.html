					<description><![CDATA[How do you repay a mentor? I think one of the best ways is by being a mentor to others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the delightful surprises of my career has been mentors. I‚Äôm grateful that people have reached out and taken an interest in me. If life lessons only came through our own mistakes we would be miserable. Having a mentor to listen, give suggestions, and encourage based on their life experience is priceless.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction.<br><em>John C. Crosby</em></p></blockquote>



<p>I have been thinking about how to thank these people. I can‚Äôt afford gold watches.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think the best thank you is to ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù through mentoring others.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A lot of people have gone further than they thought they could because someone else thought they could.<br><em>Anonymous</em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Here are my invitations to you:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Remember the mentors and teachers who have changed your life. If appropriate, reach out to thank them.</li><li>Decide how you can become a mentor to someone in your circle of influence.</li></ul>



<p>This doesn‚Äôt have to be formal. Look around for someone who has potential and can benefit from the things you have learned and the people you know. Make a plan to start sharing those things.</p>



<p>Your mentors likely had mentors of their own they told you about. One of the greatest gifts I was given through a mentor was an introduction to the writing of&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;mentor.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best way a mentor can prepare another leader is to expose him or her to other great people.<br><em>John C. Maxwell</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Thank you for that and everything else CS.</p>
