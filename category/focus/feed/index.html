<p>On my computer I love the option to have a window take up the entire screen. Not just to maximize it to cover the desktop, but filling the entire screen. As I write this I have only one window visible, no menu bar or icons in the dock. Do Not Disturb mode is enabled. Right now this computer is only capable of doing one thing.</p>



<p>Knowledge work, the kind of work many of us do all day, revolves around writing. For hundreds of years writing was a pretty simple task. Whether it was a letter, a recipe, or a novel, the person writing had a pen and some paper. The paper could be a loose sheet or part of a bound book. The pen could be a fountain pen or a quill or a ballpoint. The essential ingredients for this kind of work were simple.</p>



<p>Typewriters were a new tool in knowledge work, but the essential task was the same. One sheet of paper and one typewriter. The writer pressed on keys, letters and symbols were imprinted on the paper, and that was that. It wasn’t very efficient and if you made a mistake it meant some sort of manual correction, but pen and paper had the same challenge.</p>



<p>Computers and mobile devices changed this. Fixing mistakes was so easy! Press a key and delete the mistake. Sharing the work was much easier too. Email meant sending your work cost nothing and it arrived in an instant.</p>



<p>Technology made things better in so many ways, but it has also changed the equation. Rather than <strong>facilitating</strong> the basic tasks we do, it actively <strong>tries to take our attention away</strong> from that task. How many of your phone’s notifications do you really need to see right now? How often does a computer ping take you away from something you are doing in real life?</p>



<p>I don’t know that I have very many answers, but I know that when my focus is on only one thing at a time I get much more done.</p>



<p>It seems counter intuitive to work this way. Computers have trained us all to try and multi-task. They call out that this is the only way to do knowledge work. It must be right!</p>



<p>Remember that long before computers dinged for every email and pinged for every new YouTube video, people like you worked by single tasking. You don’t have to revert to pen and paper or a typewriter to get the benefits that kind of work brings.</p>

<p>Worthwhile pursuits are hard. Work worth doing involves struggle. This is one of the lessons I wish I had learned earlier in life.</p>



<p>This afternoon I saw a perfect example of this. We had a small, Friday afternoon emergency at work. A customer needed a very specific data set that I knew was in our database but that I didn’t know how to retrieve. A coworker stepped up and saved the day.</p>



<p>She has been studying a monster book called <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/sql-queries-for-mere-mortals-a-hands-on-guide-to-data-manipulation-in-sql/9780134858333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQL for Mere Mortals</a> <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/sql-queries-for-mere-mortals-a-hands-on-guide-to-data-manipulation-in-sql/oclc/1023657978" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(public library)</a>.</em> This is not light reading. It’s the kind of book you should never read while laying on your back—if you fall asleep and it drops on your face it’ll break your nose. I know studying it has been a chore.</p>



<p>She crafted a query that gave us exactly what we needed. The hard work she’s been putting in paid off.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a> Jerry Seinfeld said “If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting. That’s my way of life.”</p>



<p>Embracing hard work and the focus needed to do hard work is unusual. Most people don’t work this way. But if we want to accomplish great things it’s the right path.</p>

<p>Listening to music with musicians is interesting. Most musicians I know think of listening to music as an activity you do exclusively; not while reading a book, not while looking at your phone, or while working on email. The music deserves full attention while it’s playing. You learn and gain from the music by listening attentively and deeply.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that musicians don’t like background music. They do, but they also have the annoying habit of actually listening to the background music much more than normal people do. (If you’re friends with musicians you’ve probably had the experience where they groan for no reason or interrupt you to say “I love this song” when you were unaware there was music playing.)</p>



<p>Imagine if everyone listened deeply all the time. How would our conversations be different? How much time could we save in meetings? How many misunderstandings could be avoided? How much more affection would we perceive? The next time you’re in a situation where listening is important, whether to music, to a friend, or even to the news, listen deeply.</p>

<p>It’s the time of year when we think about where we are, where we want to be, and what we should do to get there. I love the new year. Setting goals can be great and keeping new years resolutions, even for a few days or weeks, is a good thing.</p>



<p>As you take time to set goals, consider adding some “Do Not” goals to your list. Instead of adding more and more things to your already busy life, decide what things you want to subtract or stop doing. There is a beauty in progress by subtraction.</p>



<p>As you create space and time by not adding things to your to do list, you’ll be able to focus deeply on important things. The best work you do is deep work, and that takes time and concentration.</p>



<p>Simplify. Focus. Single task. Concentrate exclusively on the work you are doing at this moment. Great progress comes through the accumulation of small gains.</p>



<p>Here’s to a happy, productive, and peaceful new year!</p>

<p>One of my favorite writers, <a href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin Kleon</a>, wrote in his book <em>Steal Like an Artist</em> of how we are all mashups. From our genetics to our creative influences, we are the sum of many parts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said ‘We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.’</p></blockquote>



<p>We are also shaped by our habits. I worry that in my life I too often choose to dive into a screen rather than spending time thinking or reading. Activities that used to be confined to our computers, such as social media, now live in our pockets and are available all the time.</p>



<p>Making hard decisions about what we allow on our devices can make a huge difference in our quality of life.</p>



<p>I don’t need a world of on-demand video on my phone. If it’s there I will spend time watching it.</p>



<p>I don’t need Twitter (or Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or Pinterest) on my phone. I’ll never be bored enough to get the benefits of boredom if I’m never more than a moment away from more content.</p>



<p>I don’t need notifications for most apps. Notifications pull my attention away from doing work (or anything else!) deeply and with quality. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Context switching</a> is brutal and I want to avoid it whenever possible.</p>



<p>Most of the convenience our devices give us is garbage. It’s input we should avoid. I need to curate the influences in my life because those influences shape who I am.</p>
